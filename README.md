# Tank Level Regulation Using PID Control

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a closed-loop **tank level regulation system** designed and simulated using **Factory I/O** and **Siemens TIA Portal**.

The control strategy ensures accurate and stable level regulation within the defined operating range.

---

## Control Strategy
- Bidirectional control using **charge and discharge valves**
- PID-based regulation for high precision
- Deadband logic to reduce oscillations
- Designed operating range: **0–100 level units**

This approach prioritizes control accuracy and fast settling in the valid range.

---

## Control System
- PLC: **Siemens S7-1200**
- Control method: PID
- HMI monitoring:
  - Setpoint input
  - Actual level display
  - Trends (SP / PV / Output)
  - Alarm indications
